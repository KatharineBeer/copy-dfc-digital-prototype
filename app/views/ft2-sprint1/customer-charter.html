      <p class="govuk-body">This Customer Charter sets out the things that you should expect from the National Careers Service. The following statements will help you to judge whether you have received a good service from us.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">As a customer when I contact the National Careers Service:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>Staff will advise me about the best ways to use the service depending on my
needs, interests and circumstances. They will tell me more about using the

<li>A qualified careers adviser will consider my needs, interests and
circumstances. They will give me useful, up to date information and advice
that can help me to make good choices about learning and work.</li>
<li>I will help to make my meeting with the National Careers Service a success
by keeping appointments, sharing information and being open to new ideas.</li>
<li>My National Careers Service adviser will encourage me to participate fully in

<li>My adviser will tell me about Apprenticeships and Traineeships if I am

<li>If my adviser thinks that another service can help me, they will put me in

<li>I will always receive an apology and a clear explanation if my appointment is
delayed or cancelled for any reason.</li>

serviceâ€™s Customer Charter to help me respond.</li>
