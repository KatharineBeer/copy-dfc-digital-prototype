              <li>WCAG 2.1 AA standards were considered and reported against</li>
              <li>the browser used was IE11 as this is standard in the ESFA</li>
              <li>testing was done with 2 different screen reader packages, as they often interact differently with a page</li>
              <li>testing was carried out using only keyboard, keyboard commands and voice where applicable - a mouse or similar device was not used</li>
              <li>during testing, consideration was given to usability and to neurodiversity</li>
              <li>compatibility and usability cannot be guaranteed for people who access the system outside of the ESFA network, as it is not possible to test for every browser, operating system and accessibility software package</li>
